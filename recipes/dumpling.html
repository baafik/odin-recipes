    <h3>How to Make Homemade Dumplings</h3>
    <p>A dumpling is a small mass of dough that can be boiled, fried, baked, or steamed. There are a ton of dumpling varieties out there, from pork- and cabbage-filled Chinese dumplings to cheesy Polish dumplings. These boiled drop dumplings, which are popular in the U.S., are often paired with chicken and broth to create a popular comfort food called chicken and dumplings.They're prepared by dropping spoonfuls of dough into a pot of boiling soup or stew. The starch in the dumplings thickens the broth, resulting in a rich stew that's impossible to resist.</p>

    <p>Making a dumpling can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below :</p>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong>
            These dumplings start with all-purpose flour, which creates structure and holds the other ingredients together.</li>
        <li><strong>Powder:</strong> 
            Baking powder is a leavening agent, which means it releases gas that makes the dough expand. It's responsible for the dumplings' light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> 
            A teaspoon of sugar adds an extremely subtle hint of sweetness. It also helps the dumplings retain their moisture through the cooking process and slows gluten development, which ensures tender dumplings.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong>
            A pinch of salt seasons the dumplings and enhances the flavors of the other ingredients. </li>
        <li><strong>Butter or Margarine:</strong>
            Cold butter or margarine is cut into the flour mixture to bind the dry ingredients together. It also keeps the dumplings light and tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong>
            Whole milk helps create a smooth, moist dough.</li>
       
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Stir in milk and mix until a batter forms that is thick enough to be scooped with a spoon. Allow batter to rest for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drop batter by spoonfuls into boiling stew or soup. Cover and simmer without lifting the lid for 15 minutes. Serve.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
